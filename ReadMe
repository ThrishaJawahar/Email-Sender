This Django project enables users to send emails through a simple web form, capturing the subject, recipient, message, and sender's name. Upon submission, the application sends both plain text and HTML-rendered emails, using Django's template system. It also includes error handling to manage any issues during the email process, demonstrating the integration of form handling, email functionality, and template rendering in Django.
